<h1 id="docklet-what-and-why">Docklet: What and Why</h1>
<hr />
<h2 id="what-is-docklet">What is Docklet</h2>
<h3 id="definition-and-architecture">Definition and Architecture</h3>
<p>Docklet is an open source project from Software Engineering Institute,
Peking University. It is released uner the <a href="http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/License:BSD_3Clause">New BSD License</a>. Its source code is hosted in GitHub.</p>
<p>Docklet is designed to be a lightweight Cloud operating system for small
scale data centers.  It provides a solution of <strong>Personal Development
Workspace in the Cloud</strong> for enterprises. With the help of Docklet,
enterprises can easily virtualize their small scale data centers,
creating virtualized clusters for their staff users, and then providing
users a customizable <strong>Workspace</strong> in the cloud.  Users only need a
modern <strong>browser</strong> to visit their own <strong>Workspace</strong> located in the
enterprise's Intranet from anywhere, at anytime. They can do works like
online editing source codes, debugging, testing, managing data files,
analyzing data, visualizing results, etc.</p>
<p><img alt="docklet architecture" src="../img/docklet-architecture.jpg" /></p>
<p>The kernel technology of Docklet is LXC virtual cluster (vcluster) that
is based on Linux Container (LXC) and software defined networks
technologies. The Docklet <strong>vcluster</strong> provides a virtualization
solution of physical clusters, supports the installation and running of
most existing Linux applications. </p>
<p>Based on vcluster, Docklet provides users their <strong>Personal Workspace</strong>. 
Users visit their Workspace throught the integrated <a href="https://github.com/jupyter/notebook">Jupyper Notebook</a> to do most development tasks.</p>
<h3 id="docklet-and-docker">Docklet and Docker</h3>
<p>Docklet has no direct relationship with <a href="https://github.com/docker/docker">Docker</a>. They are two different projects, with totally different design goals.</p>
<p>The goal of Docker is to provide a lightweight operating system
virtualization solution. It is in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">IaaS layer</a> of cloud computing architecture.
Docker encapsulates LXC to make LXC easy, 
so that <a href="https://www.gitbook.com/book/yeasy/docker_practice">the users can operate a Docker container as simple as operate
a fast and lightweight virtual machine</a>. Although later on Docker has clustering component, 
it in essence still focuses on single node operating system layer.  </p>
<p>The goal of Docklet is to provide <strong>Personal Development Workspace in
the Cloud</strong> solution. It covers all the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">SaaS, PaaS and IaaS layer</a> of cloud computing architecture.
The basic of Docklet is LXC vcluster, but not Docker container. For
Docklet users, what they face directly is their Workspace. They use
browser to do software development, debuging and testing, etc, using tools
Docklet provide, working in a high layer.</p>
<h2 id="why-using-docklet">Why using Docklet</h2>
<p>As a "<strong>Workspace Cloud</strong>", Docklet has several advantages.</p>
<p>First, what Docklet provides is a virtual workspace for developers, but
not only an Iaas or PaaS solution, therefore more friendly to developers.</p>
<p>Second, the Docklet vcluster provides a high efficient and simple method
of sharing physical resources, therefore more friendly to
administrators.</p>
<p>The detailed advantages and features of Docklet include:</p>
<h3 id="wide-applicability">Wide applicability</h3>
<p>Docklet is not designed for large data center, but for small or <strong>mini
data center</strong>. By <strong>mini data center</strong>, we mean a cluster with not more than 100
physical hosts, all connected by high speed network, each host with
relatively high performance. This is the common configuration of most
medium or small enterprises and institutes. Therefore, Docklet has a
wide applicability.</p>
<h3 id="easily-sharing-cluster-among-frameworks">Easily Sharing Cluster among Frameworks</h3>
<p>Traditionally clusters are often monopolized, serving only one kind of
application framework, e.g., MPI or Spark.  It is usually difficult to
share the physcal cluster among different frameworks.</p>
<p><a href="http://mesos.apache.org">Mesos</a> and
<a href="https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/YARN.html">Yarn</a> each try to provide a mechanism of sharing clusters. However, they require extra work of customization for each supported framework, which seems not flexible and a bit difficult.</p>
<p>Docklet provides a flexible and easy solution. By virtualizing the
physical clusters, almost all computing frameworks can run in the
LXC vcluster seamlessly without any customization and modification.</p>
<h3 id="dynamically-and-elastically-configure-resources">Dynamically and Elastically Configure Resources</h3>
<p>Docklet vcluster supports elastically configuring resources. Users can
add a fully functional LXC node to existing vcluster instantly by just a
click. This feature is useful for the application frameworks that
support elastic resource management, e.g., Spark.</p>
<p>Docklet can monitor the activity of users, smartly finding those not at work, 
then adjust their resource quota dynamically. This can bring about good
usage experience for online active users, together with reasonable
resource utilization. </p>
<h3 id="consuming-very-few-network-resources">Consuming Very Few Network Resources</h3>
<p>Docklet utilizes the technology of software defined networks. 
The inner vclusters will use private Internet address space, e.g.,
<code>172.16/16</code>, not consuming public Internet addresses. The administrator
only need to configure <strong>one</strong> public Internet address/URL for Docklet
portal.  Users use just a modern browser to access their private
vcluster located behind the enterprise's firewall through the portal's 
public URL. This feature is very attractive for those enterprises
without so many public Internet addresses.</p>
<h3 id="user-friendly">User Friendly</h3>
<p>Docklet is mainly targeted for enterprises's staff developers. It is
domain oriented, therefore can be setup to meet the enterprise's
requirements deliberately. The public base image has most often used
software. Users can directly start their programming and analyzing job
with just a browser, without the heavy burden of installing and
configuring the physical clusters, installation of software frameworks, 
management of images, etc. Therefore, it is very friently to end users,
which is especially important for those non-export users.</p>
<h3 id="ideal-environment-for-application-development-and-testing">Ideal Environment for Application Development and Testing</h3>
<p>The easy usage of Docklet means it can be an ideal environment for
application development and testing. For example, users can program and
debug a big data analyzing software with a small data set (possibly
Gigabye scale). If success, then deploy it to production system with
true big data. In fact, for most data analyzing and mining jobs, their
data set is usually not so large, which means they can directly run and
output the final results in Docklet.</p>
<p>Docklet is also a good platform for exercising programming skills and
studying programming languages. No need to install kinds of tools, just
a browser is OK.</p>
<h3 id="easy-to-customize-and-extend">Easy to Customize and Extend</h3>
<p>The enterprise's Docklet administrator is free to make specific public base
images. The users can also install new software not in the base image.
What is more, the users can save their Workspace as image and then share
with others, which is very convenient for users of one group.</p>
<h3 id="supporting-multiple-users">Supporting Multiple Users</h3>
<p>Docklet vcluster naturally supports multiple users. Each user has their
own private vcluster independenlty.  Each vcluster can run different
frameworks such as MPI and Spark without worry about interference.
Therefore, it can satisfy the different requirements of different users.</p>
<h3 id="advantages-of-lxc">Advantages of LXC</h3>
<p>Docklet uses LXC technology. Therefore, it has the advantages of LXC and
LXC-based solutions like Docker, including instant booting container in seconds;
high utilization of resources, running thousands of containers in one
physical host; high performance of applications; consuming less
resources; fast delivery; simple management, etc.</p></div>
